WebScraper
--------------------------
It can scrape information from Gumtree.com.au by searching a particular keyword(Garage sales in this instance), and print out the name of the publisher, locations of the said items and the adrress of the classified.

Work in Progress:
I am working on extrating the geo locations and publishing them to a google map next.
